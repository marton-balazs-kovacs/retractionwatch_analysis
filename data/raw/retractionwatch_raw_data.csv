Start Date,End Date,Response Type,Progress,Duration (in seconds),Finished,Recorded Date,Response ID,Distribution Channel,User Language,"Dear Colleague,

We found your paper in the Retraction Watch database (http://retractiondatabase.org/) and we would like to ask 5 short questions about the mistakes that you identify behind this unfortunate event.  


In this study, we examine the types and causes of data management mistakes made in retracted scientific papers. Our survey aims to help researchers by highlighting those honest mistakes that can potentially lead to retractions.



We value your time so we tried to make this survey as short as possible. Completing the survey takes an average of 3 minutes.



We link your answers to the retracted paper only for analytical purposes. Neither the title of the paper nor any information on the authors of the retracted paper will be shared publicly. Only your survey responses and the reasons behind the retraction will be made publicly available in a way that they cannot be linked to you.



I hereby declare that I have understood and accept the information given above and in the detailed informed consent form (https://osf.io/3sc46), and I give my consent to participate in this survey as well as to the processing of all the data I provide and to share my anonymous responses.

There were no SSD hard drives or google drives in that era. So I felt that journal should have issued a correction and given oprion to upload new scans of old autorads instead of retraction. Moreover why only Scientist is held responsible, The Journal also should have checked the data prior to publishing as they take publication charges",I learnt the lesson in a hard way.

The research group unanimously agreed to retract the study, including the Ph.D. student whose thesis relied on that paper. However, I felt upset when discussing the decision to retract the already published study with other colleagues. I heard comments such as, ""It's a waste of time,"" ""Your prestige will be affected,"" and the most interesting one, ""Don't do it. Manuscripts follow the evolution theory, and if your results are wrong, they won't be replicated. Consequently, no one will pay attention to them anymore.

It has become challenging to produce replicable and valuable effects given the current context where empiricism lacks realism, and realism lacks consistency and congruency. Researchers may often define phenomena based solely on their own instrumental interpretations without grounding their discoveries in previous stable effects, leading to frequent rediscovery of wheels and aliens. The limitations of human time, resources, and cognitive processing further complicate matters in the vast sea of publications.

Nevertheless, I believe that new AI implementations in scientific databases and meta-analysis approaches, such as neurosyth, will be employed to test the consistency of our results using both numerical and qualitative criteria.

This of course had an impact on the global interpretation of the findings. Best course of action seemed to be retraction rather than an erratum.,"The error probably should have been caught in the review process as the descriptive summary data did not clearly align with values consistent with volumetrics. However, we overlooked this and reviewers did not notice this either. We only figured it out during an attempt at replicating the effect and found lower than expected correlations between the two datasets.",not modified,not modified
