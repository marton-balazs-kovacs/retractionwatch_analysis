I heard comments such as, ""It's a waste of time,"" ""Your prestige will be affected,"" and the most interesting one, ""Don't do it.

It has become challenging to produce replicable and valuable effects given the current context where empiricism lacks realism, and realism lacks consistency and congruency. Researchers may often define phenomena based solely on their own instrumental interpretations without grounding their discoveries in previous stable effects, leading to frequent rediscovery of wheels and aliens. The limitations of human time, resources, and cognitive processing further complicate matters in the vast sea of publications.
