Start Date,End Date,Response Type,Progress,Duration (in seconds),Finished,Recorded Date,Response ID,Distribution Channel,User Language,"We found your paper in the Retraction Watch database (http://retractiondatabase.org/) and we would like to ask 5 short questions about the mistakes that you identify behind this unfortunate event.  



In this study, we examine the types and causes of data management mistakes made in retracted social science papers. Our survey aims to help researchers by highlighting those honest mistakes that can potentially lead to retractions.



We value your time so we tried to make this survey as short as possible. Completing the survey takes an average of 3 minutes.



We link your answers to the retracted paper only for analytical purposes. Neither the title of the paper nor any information on the authors of the retracted paper will be shared publicly. Only your survey responses and the reasons behind the retraction will be made publicly available in a way that they cannot be linked to you.



I hereby declare that I have understood and accept the information given above and in the detailed informed consent form (https://osf.io/3sc46), and I give my consent to participate in this survey as well as to the processing of all the data I provide and to share my anonymous responses.
