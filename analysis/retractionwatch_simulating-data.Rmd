# Source R scripts
r_scripts <- list.files(here::here("R/"), full.names = TRUE)
purrr::walk(r_scripts, source)
```

For the preregistration we will simulate a source datafile to prepare and register the analysis scripts. For the generation of the datafile we are using two test responses to the survey on Qulatrics to ensure that the datafile structure and variable names are similar to the actual dataset.

We will only prepare the source datafile by simulation. Any other modifications will be done by the analysis scripts.

# Load data

```{r}
source <- read_csv(here("data/simulation/retractionwatch_survey_April+19,+2023_13.04.csv"))
```

# Create codebook

For the source datafile we will create a codebook based on the Qualtrics datafile before we simulate additional data. Qulatrics records meta information on each variable in the first two rows of the datafile. We will use this as a starting point to generate the codebook.

```{r}
codebook <-
  source %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "variable_name", values_to = "description") %>% 
  mutate(
    # Since all columns will be character when downloaded from Qulatrics the variable type will be the same everywhere
    variable_type = "character"
    )

# Save the codebook
readr::write_csv(codebook, here("data/source/retractionwatch_source_codebook.csv"))
```

# Simulate new responses

  "Programming error (e.g. analysis code error, error in scipt, mistake in ecperiment code, mistake in programming the data collection code, program coding error)",
  "Project management error (error in time management; miscommunication; not showing up for data collection; team member left the lab)",
  "Technical/infrastructural problem (e.g. recording device not recording properly, failure of data collection software, technical failure, software error, technical issue with computer in recording)",
  "Version control error (e.g. failure to locate original data, overwriting data, overwriting files, using the wrong version of code, using the wrong version of data)",
  "Sharing confidential data (e.g. compromising participantsâ€™ anonimity, failure to anonymize participants, not anonymizing data, privacy breach, recording data without ethical permission)",
  "Incorrect data processing/analysis (e.g. calculating wrong statistic, mistake in data analysis, incorrect application of formulas, formula error, statistical error)",
  "Incorrect reporting (e.g. misreporting values, plotting mistake, presenting inaccurate data, publishing with errors, reporting wrong data)",
  "Incorrect software or hardware settings (e.g. allowing missing data in survey, failure to calibrate data collector equipment, wrong settings in experimental program, wrong software settings)",
  "Other, please specify:"

  "Project management issue (e.g. disorganization, error in team management, lack of clear job responsibilities, lack of coordination, lack of supervision)",
  "Risking human error (e.g. experimenter error; lack of automatization; manual task handling instead of code; manually doing a task; multitasking)",
  "Technical issue (e.g. computer issue, equipment failure, software error, technical malfunction, wrong equipment settings)",
